description: David Copperfield enjoys an idyllic life with his gentle, widowed mother
  and his loving nurse, Peggotty. Then tragedy strikes when Mr. Murdstone weds David's
  mother and drives her to an early grave. Despised by his stepfather, the boy is
  forced to live in misery and poverty until he runs away to throw himself upon the
  mercy of his eccentric aunt. Charles Dickens's classic tale of growing up.
